Demonstration
1. Drawing lanes on paint (continuous and dashed)
2. Still photos 
3. Youtube video

Questions
1. Optimization (increase FPS)
2. Merge similar lines into singular line
    - check slope value with most lines
        - check similar x's and y's 
        - take average of all slopes, x's, and y's
    "maximum gap distance before it becomes one line"

MODIFIABLE VALUES
[Globals]
drive	        whether or not to apply autoinput
police_dash	    settings for police cam video

[Lines]:
line_min	    minimum line length to be considered a line
gap_max		    maximum gap between points to be considered a line

[Color Selection]:
lower		    lower bound for HSL color
upper 		    upper bound for HSL color

[Edge Detection]:
(#, #)		    Gaussian Blur kernel (must be odd numbers)
min, max	    Canny Edge Hysteresis Threshold values
		        "Any edges with intensity gradient more than "max" are sure to be edges and those below "min" are sure to be
		        non-edges, so discarded. Those who lie between these two thresholds are classified edges or non-edges based
		        on their connectivity."

[Region]:
vertices	    Vertices that contain the region of interest

[PopulateLineLists]:
s_threshold     Slope magnitude must be above this to pass through the non-horizontal line filter

[LineFilter]:
rel_tol		    Tolerance for comparing similarity between the two lines




/****** REVIEW *****/
Color Selection:
pros - can choose both yellow and white lanes and ignore other colors
cons - have to know color range in HSL
     - hard to find lanes in the shade
