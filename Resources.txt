-download GTAV Native trainer
  - get rid of pedestrians and other drivers
  - spawn and use any motorbike
  - set time to "midday" when it's light out and least amount of shadows

/****** MODIFIABLE VALUES *******/
[Globals]
drive	        whether or not to apply autoinput
police_dash	    settings for police cam video

[Lines]:
line_min	    minimum line length to be considered a line
gap_max		    maximum gap between points to be considered a line

[Color Selections]:
lower		    lower bound for color
upper 		    upper bound for color

[Edge Detection]:
(#, #)		    Gaussian Blur kernel (must be odd numbers)
min, max	    Canny Edge Hysteresis Threshold values
		        "Any edges with intensity gradient more than "max" are sure to be edges and those below "min" are sure to be
		        non-edges, so discarded. Those who lie between these two thresholds are classified edges or non-edges based
		        on their connectivity."

[Region]:
vertices	    Vertices that contain the region of interest

[PopulateLineLists]:
s_threshold     Slope magnitude must be above this to pass through the non-horizontal line filter

[LineFilter]:
rel_tol		    Tolerance for comparing similarity between the two lines



/****** REVIEW ******/
Color Selection:
pros - can choose both yellow and white lanes and ignore other colors
     - can look at individual color channels
cons - have to know color range in HSL, HSV, etc
     - hard to white lanes in the shade

Bird's Eye View:
pros - can find the curvature of the lane
     - never need to process the extraneous objects in the image
cons - very sensitive to turns
     - need a large field of view to accurately extract lane data



/***** QUESTIONS *****/
1. Optimization (increase FPS)
     - use win32gui to capture frames
2. Merge similar lines into singular line
    - check slope value with most lines
        - check similar x-ints and y-ints
        - take average of all slopes, x-ints, and y-ints
3. Finding lanes in the shade
    - convert to HSV or HSL color space and single out individual channels
      and play with the color thresholding to extract the lanes under low light
