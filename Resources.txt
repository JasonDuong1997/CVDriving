Demonstration
1. Drawing lanes on paint (continuous and dashed)
2. Still photos 
3. Youtube video

Questions
1. Optimization (increase FPS)
2. Merge similar lines into singular line
    - check slope value with most lines
        - check similar x's and y's 
        - take average of all slopes, x's, and y's
    "maximum gap distance before it becomes one line"
