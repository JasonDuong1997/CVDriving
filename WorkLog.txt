Done:
-average the lines across multiple frames
-finish PyGTAV tutorial
-finish 30 day blog walkthrough
-fix re-shape error
-created cnn with save and load functions
-tweak cnn hyperparameters and add dropout nodes
-feed processed lane images to convnet
-implemented PilotNet
-collect 100,000 samples
-convert Udacity dataset from rosbag to csv
-lower learning rate and increase number of epochs to allow the model to train better
-make sure model is loading correctly. check "test" file for loading example
-added early stopping

TODO List:
-dynamic source points for BEV (bird's eye view)
    -work with 3rd person POV
-weighted average for lines
-drop outlier lanes when they're too off
-mapping out the road
-vertically stretch road
-collect samples for right and left steering

-look up "grid search" for testing hyperparameter values

IMPORTANT
-double data with horizontal flip
-use k-fold validation, Near Optimal Learning Rate BP Algorithm
-change graph so it only plots every epoch instead of every cycle
-use Grid Search to test different learning rates
-check  Cyclic Learning Rates
